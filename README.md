# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
This is my begineers project in deep learning. 
In this project I have used mnist dataset. It is a dataset of 60,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9.
The task is to recognise or classify the given handwritten image into one of the 10 classes from integer 0 to 9.
This project is based on Convolutional neural network where I have not used the hidden layer in my network.
I have used Keras library in my classifier, it helps me in achieving 98% of accuracy on my mnist handwritten digit dataset.
